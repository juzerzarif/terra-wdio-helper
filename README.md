# Terra WDIO Helper

An exension to help with analyzing test results, specifically screenshots captured by the [terra-toolkit WDIO utility](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit). This extension is aimed at making traversing through screenshots generated by WDIO tests easier and more efficient.

## Features

This extension aggregates all snapshots under a spec across all locales and viewports and displays them in a webview for easy access. Enables GitHub style image diffing providing more diff options than the default image diff generated by WDIO.
